# MaskDetectionSurvey
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to pose a great challenge to the world since its outbreak. The coronavirus
epidemics have forced people wear masks to counteract the transmission of virus, which also brings difficulties to monitor
large groups of people wearing masks.

In this paper, we primarily focus on the AI techniques of masked facial detection and related datasets. We survey the recent advances, beginning with the descriptions of masked facial detection datasets. Thirteen available datasets are described and discussed in details. Then, the methods are roughly categorized into two classes: conventional methods and neural network-based methods. 

Finally, we summarize the recent benchmarking results, give the discussions on the limitations of datasets and methods, and expand future research directions. To our knowledge, this is the first survey about masked facial detection methods and datasets. Hopefully our survey could provide some help to fight against epidemics.
